<h1 style="color:blue; font-size: 36px;">Passionate Learner Exploring AI and Education</h1>

As a psychologist with a deep interest in **learning** and **pedagogy**, Iâ€™m thrilled by the possibilities that **AI tools** bring to the table. Currently diving into **prompt engineering**, Iâ€™m fascinated by how these technologies can enhance our understanding of education.

> <strong style="font-size: 18px;">My focus</strong> lies on understanding how **AI** will transform the learning landscapeâ€”not to replace traditional education, but to **amplify** it.

I believe in leveraging AI to maximize potential, providing smarter ways to learn and teach, while keeping the human element central to the process.

I'm constantly seeking out new ways to integrate **AI** into **education systems** and considering how we can shape the future of learning with these tools at our disposal.
